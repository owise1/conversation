# Conversation

A computer you can chat with.

I heard that the way Google Translate can translate text from one language to another is not because Google engineers have discovered the underlying, fundamental building blocks of human language and turned that into a computer algorithm. In fact, the google algorithm has nothing to do with the types of things an academic linguist might study. 

Instead, Google uses sheer brute force.  When you type an English phrase into Google Translate hoping to get Spanish back, their computers search through billions and billions of texts that are in both English and Spanish.  When they find a match for your phrase in an English text, they return its Spanish counterpart.  Super simple if you have a large enough database and fast enough computers. No need to solve the pesky problem of determining how human language actually works or modeling the human mind in computer code.  Just search for a best match.

Now, I'm not sure that anecdote is even true, but I sure like the sound of it.  So this is same methodology we're going to use to create a computer that you can have a conversation with.
