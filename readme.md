# Conversation

A computer you can chat with.

I heard that the way Google Translate translates text from one language to another is not because Google engineers have discovered the underlying, fundamental building bloks of human language and tuned that into a computer algorythm. In fact, the google algorythm has nothing to do with the types of things an academic linguist might study. 

Instead, Google uses sheer brute force.  When you type an English phrase into Google Translate hoping to get Spanish back, their computers search through billions and billions of texts that are in both English and Spanish.  When it finds a match for your phrase in an English text, it returns to you the Spanish counterpart.  Super simple if you have a large enough database and fast enough computers. No need to figure out how human language actually works or model the human mind in computer code.  Just search for a best match.

Now, I'm not sure that anecdote is ever true, but I like the sound of it.  So this is same methodology we're going to use to create a computer that you can have a conversation with.
